### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a backend developer. I have been programming for more than 2 years, mainly with PHP, but I have also programmed 
in other languages such as Java (which I started with), Javascript and Python. I'm interested in improving my skills 
and learning how things work (what's behind the scenes). In my free time I like to read articles or watch videos about 
good programming practices.
